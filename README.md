# Displaying GDP per capita for European countries

I designed a tkinter interface in python to display the GDP per capita of European countries.

## Data

I started my project by retrieving the necessary data from the World Bank, which you can find [right here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=EU).

I then continued, keeping only the data I needed and sorting it. I ended up with the following intuitive dataset: world_gdp_capita.csv

## Interface

I opted for a choice of checkbuttons which seemed to me to be the best choice for this. There would be a way to improve the interface by adding buttons to be able to change continent and to analyse the GDP per capita of other countries.
